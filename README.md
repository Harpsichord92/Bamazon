## Application

### Bamazon Customer
BamazonCustomer will give the user an inventory of items to purchase from. The inventory of items will be displayed through a table with properties of item_id, product_name, department_name, price, and stock_quantity. The application will prompt the user to select a product_id, then asks how much of that product the user would like to purchase. It will then return the total cost to the user.
